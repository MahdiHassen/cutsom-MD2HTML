# cutsom-MD2HTML

CustomMD2HTML is a lightweight Markdown editor that converts Markdown files into HTML with customizable tags. I created this to automatically convert Markdown into HTML that fits into my blog.

## Features
- Live HTML Preview – See changes in real-time as you edit your Markdown.
- Customizable HTML Tags – Modify default p and blockquote tags.
- Easy File Management – Open, edit, and save .md files.
- Settings Persistence – Configuration is saved automatically to md_converter_config.json.
